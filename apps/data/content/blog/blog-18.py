        "<p class='mb-4 text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg'>Choosing which project to tackle first can feel overwhelming‚Äîespecially when every task seems urgent, complex, or high stakes.

        "<h3 class='text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6'>üß© Why Project Prioritization Matters</h3>",
        "<p class='mb-4 text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg'>Project prioritization is the process of organizing tasks based on urgency, difficulty, and potential impact. Without it, you risk wasting valuable energy on low-impact projects or missing critical deadlines. In fact, managing priorities well is often the difference between feeling productive and feeling stuck.</p>",
        
        "<h3 class='text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6'>‚è±Ô∏è Time Management Is Your First Tool</h3>",
        "<p class='mb-4 text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg'>Good time management opens the door to effective prioritization. When you allocate your time intentionally, it becomes easier to determine which projects should take precedence. Think of time as your resource map‚Äîand priority as your compass.</p>",

        "<p class='mb-3 text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg'>To prioritize projects wisely, ask yourself:</p>",
        "<ul class='mb-4 ml-6 space-y-2'>",
        "<li class='text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg'><strong>Deadline pressure:</strong> Which project is due the soonest?</li>",
        "<li class='text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg'><strong>Complexity level:</strong> Which task requires more time or deeper focus?</li>",
        "<li class='text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg'><strong>Consequences of delay:</strong> What happens if a certain project isn't completed on time?</li>",
        "</ul>",
        "<p class='mb-4 text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg'>I typically prioritize projects with the nearest deadlines. Once that's done, I assess difficulty and consequence. Why? Because sometimes, the most challenging project also has the highest stakes‚Äîespecially if it affects a client, team, or larger mission.</p>",

        "<p class='mb-4 text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg'>Understanding <em>who</em> the project serves helps shape your strategy. If a complex project has major consequences and limited time to complete, it's worth rethinking your workflow. Break it down, find collaborators, or adjust expectations‚Äîbut never ignore the time-pressure factor.</p>",
        "<p class='mb-4 text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg'>Balancing all these dimensions ensures that by the end of your timeline, your work hits three essential marks: <strong>on time</strong>, <strong>on target</strong>, and <strong>realistic‚Äînot necessarily perfect</strong>.</p>",

It's about optimizing your process so you can show up consistently and complete what matters most. With every project you rank and execute strategically, you build stronger habits for long-term success.</p>"
